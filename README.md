# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

	The goal of this project is to discover how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I have gathered campaign outcomes based on these parameters.  Included are graphs displaying these relationships.

### Purpose

	Through this analysis, I hope to provide insight to the trends of sucessful campaigns to provide guidance for future kickstarters.
