# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

	The goal of this project is to discover how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I have gathered campaign outcomes based on these parameters.  Included are graphs displaying these relationships.

### Purpose

	Through this analysis, I hope to provide insight to the trends of sucessful campaigns to provide guidance to Louise for future kickstarters.

## Analysis and Challenges
	For this challenge, we formulated the data to view what relationships, if any, exist between launch dates and their outcomes and theater funding goals and their outcomes. Visuals were created for each of these comparisons.  My Excel file is located in the zip file.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

As you can see from the below visual, we see the following trends:
- The late Spring and early Summer months yield the most successful outcomes.
- Winter months yield the fewest successful outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

As you can see by the below visual, we see the following trends:
- For goals from $0 to $10,000, the lower the goal, the higher the success rate for meeting those goals.
- For goals between $10,000 and $35,000, the rate of failure was higher than the rate of success.
- For goals between $35,000 and $45,000, the rate of success was higher.
- Any goals above $45,000 typically resulted in a failed outcome.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- I did not encounter any challenges but could see how someone could have difficulties formatting the CountIfs function.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- - It is best to launch between May and July.
- - Do not attempt a launch in the Winter.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- - I conclude that making a goal between $35,000 and $45,000 appears to be a good margin because those are the highest goals that appear to be met at the mosts successful rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- -There appears to be some outliers since the outcomes based on launch date has data that exceeds 100%.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- -We could compare goals and pledged amounts.
- -We could compare pledged amounts and outcomes.
