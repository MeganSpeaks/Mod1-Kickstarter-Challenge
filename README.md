# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

	The goal of this project is to discover how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I have gathered campaign outcomes based on these parameters.  Included are graphs displaying these relationships.

### Purpose

	Through this analysis, I hope to provide insight to the trends of sucessful campaigns to provide guidance to Louise for future kickstarters.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

As you can see from the below visual, we see the following trends:
-The late Spring and early Summer months yield the most successful outcomes.
-Winter months yield the fewest successful outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

As you can see by the below visual, we see the following trends:
- For goals from $0 to $10,000, the lower the goal, the higher the success rate for meeting those goals.
- For goals between $10,000 and $35,000, the rate of failure was higher than the rate of success.
- For goals above $35,000, the rate of success was higher.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
