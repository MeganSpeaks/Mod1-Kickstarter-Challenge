# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

	The goal of this project is to discover how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I have gathered campaign outcomes based on these parameters.  Included are graphs displaying these relationships.

### Purpose

	Through this analysis, I hope to provide insight to the trends of sucessful campaigns to provide guidance to Louise for future kickstarters.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This visual shows that the data for failed and sucessful outcomes based on goals are reflections of each other over a horizontal axis between y= 40% and y = 50%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
